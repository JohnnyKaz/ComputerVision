# Image Blending & Gradient Domain Editing

In this repository, you will find implementations of some commonly used 'traditional' image blending algorithms. Specifically:

- **Hard Edge**: simply paste the source's foreground as is to the target's background on the masked region $\to$ very basic technique, rough boundary, visible seam
- **Weighted Transition Region**: Blur the masked region and perform hard edge blending $\to$ smoother transition, looks fuzzy, may lose details, 'halo' effect
- **Laplacian Pyramid**
- **Poisson Blending**

---

**TODO:** fill the repository with the appropriate code & reports
